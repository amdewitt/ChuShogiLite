# ChuShogiLite - Embeddable Chu Shogi Web Applet
This is a piece of Chu Shogi infrastructure that can be very easily embedded in websites, and be embedded multiple times per page. It is based on the DHTML Chu Shogi Board found at https://toybox.a.la9.jp/chushogi/dhtmlchu/, but improves it in many key ways.

## Setting up ChuShogiLite a Website

To set up the applet onto your own site, do the following:

1. Go to the following website:
   * https://github.com/amdewitt/ChuShogiLite
3. Click the < > Code button, then click Download ZIP and extract the files.
   * If you only want the files necessary to run the applet, just download the 'chushogi-lite.js' and 'chushogi-lite.css' files.
5. Put the 'chushogi-lite.js' and 'chushogi-lite.css' files into the desired location.
   * Ideally both files should be in the same folder.
6. The applet is now ready to be used!
