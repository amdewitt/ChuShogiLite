# ChuShogiLite - Embeddable Chu Shogi Web Applet
This is a piece of Chu Shogi infrastructure that can be very easily embedded in websites, and be embedded multiple times per page. It is based on the DHTML Chu Shogi Board found at https://toybox.a.la9.jp/chushogi/dhtmlchu/, but improves it in many key ways.

## Setting up ChuShogiLite a Website

To set up the applet onto your own site, do the following:

1. Go to the following website:
   * https://github.com/amdewitt/ChuShogiLite
3. Click the < > Code button, then click Download ZIP.
4. Extract the files, and put the 'chushogi-lite.js' and 'chushogi-lite.css' files into the desired location.
   * Ideally both files should be put in the same locaton.
